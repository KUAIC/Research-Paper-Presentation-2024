## Abstract
>We have developed a comprehensive computer 
system to assist farmers who practice traditional farming 
methods and have limited access to agricultural experts for 
addressing crop diseases. Our system utilizes artificial 
intelligence (AI) to identify and provide remedies for vegetable 
diseases. To ensure ease of use, we have created a mobile 
application that offers a user-friendly interface, allowing 
farmers to inquire about vegetable diseases and receive suitable 
solutions in their local language. The developed system can be 
utilized by any farmer with a basic understanding of a 
smartphone. Specifically, we have designed an AI-enabled 
mobile application for identifying and suggesting remedies for 
vegetable diseases, focusing on tomato diseases to benefit the 
local farming community in Nepal. Our system employs state
of-the-art object detection methodology, namely You Only Look 
Once (YOLO), to detect tomato diseases. The detected 
information is then relayed to the mobile application, which 
provides remedy suggestions guided by domain experts. In 
order to train our system effectively, we curated a dataset 
consisting of ten classes of tomato diseases. We utilized various 
data augmentation methods to address overfitting and trained a 
YOLOv5 object detector. The proposed method achieved a 
mean average precision of 0.76 and offers an efficient mobile 
interface for interacting with the AI system. While our system is 
currently in the development phase, we are actively working 
towards enhancing its robustness and real-time usability by 
accumulating more training samples. <br><br>**Nitesh Rajbanshi**
