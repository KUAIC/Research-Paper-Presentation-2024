## Abstract
>Nepali, a low-resource language belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family and spoken in Nepal, India, Sikkim,
and Burma has comparatively very little digital content and resources, more particularly in the legal domain. However,
the need to translate legal documents is ever-increasing in the context of growing volumes of legal cases and a large
population seeking to go abroad for higher education or employment. This underscores the need for developing
an English-Nepali Machine Translation for the legal domain. We attempt to address this problem by utilizing a
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) System with an encoder-decoder architecture, specifically designed for legal
Nepali-English translation. Leveraging a custom-built legal corpus of 125,000 parallel sentences, our system achieves
encouraging BLEU scores of 7.98 in (Nepali → English) and 6.63 (English → Nepali) direction.
